# PHP Code

In this folder are 3 subfolders:

(1) task_with_guess

(2) task_with_popularity

(3) task_without_popularity

The first allows people to guess answers, e.g., number of dots in an image. 
The second creates two answers, and people will guess the right one. One 
random answer is shown first and we tell subjects it is "more popular" while 
the second answer is "less popular". Finally, the third code displays two 
answers at random as before but we never tell subjects which is popular.

The experiment runs in the following order: visitor.php -> user_start.php -> story_info_print.php -> user_complete.php
N.B.: To start experiment, make sure user first visits visitor.php.
