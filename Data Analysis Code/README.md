These are codes used to analyze data. 

- MTurkGuesses.nb plots the simulation data. 

- modelpvalues.wls is used to 
  - calculate agreement between model and data, 
  - find the likelihood ratio of the model and simpler models, and 
  - find the bootstrapped values of "r" and "p" for all data, subsets of data (dot-counting data vs line ratio data), and for different ways data is centered (around the true value vs around the mean.
